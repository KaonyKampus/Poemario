I know that I am a human being even when I am in the darkness thinking about all the time I spend 
thinking. It is like a feeling that just comes to my mind. And let me tell you. I am thinking of you as 
much as I am thinking about me and all the time we’ve been talking. This could be my most 
difficult part to show. But tonight, I just want to do it because I am a poet as you may have
realized already. I really like that presence in my life. I remember January, I remember every day, I
take into account every single moment and fact even if they seem to be small or just without
value, and if I do not remember them, I just come back into mind to see all those memories again.
Today is a little bit sad but is not because of you, is just because of life. This is most likely my
weakness during some days of happiness. Darling, you are amazing and if I write to you about
erotic things, I can also write to you about love and kindness. You are perfect to me. I know it isn’t 
been enough time, and you and I just met some nights ago. But it was enough for me to realize 
many things. You make me think that love is really there on earth, that basically it really exists, I’m
surrounded by a wave of feelings. I was forgotten by the tinny stars, but I was lifted by a gorgeous
and shiny sun; you.
